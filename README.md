# JDBC Tester

This is a simple tool to get some number on network latency.  

Also it can be used to test prepared statement from JDBC.


# Install

## Using a binary package
...

## Building from sources

Build:
```
mvn -o clean package
```		
Create a binary package
```
./scripts/package.sh
```

Then untar where you want.

## Add your JDBC Driver

If you need to access *other database than PostgreSQL, MySQL or
MSSQL*, you will have to add the JDBC Driver in the
$JDBCTESTER_HOME/lib repository.


# Usage
```
/path/to/jdbctester.sh PROPERTY_FILE [REPEAT]
```

## Configuration

You need to create a configuration file that will contain the database
access and the SQL query.

You can find 2 templates of configuration file in the jdbctester home:

- [oracle.properties](https://github.com/bdelbosc/jdbctester/blob/master/src/test/resources/oracle.properties)
- [postgresql.properties](https://github.com/bdelbosc/jdbctester/blob/master/src/test/resources/postgresql.properties)

Just copy one of them and edit to set your database credential and
driver class.

You can use a simple round trip SQL query to test only the
jdbc/network latency or choose to run complex prepared statement with
parameters.

Note that by default jdbctester.sh set the following options, you
shoud check that it matches your database locale:
```
-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US
```

## Invocation
```
/path/to/jdbctester.sh PROPERTY_FILE [REPEAT]
```

REPEAT is number of time to repeat the SQL query, the default value is
10.

Example:
```
./jdbctester.sh postgresql.properties 10
```

This will create a jdbctester.log file and output something like this:
```
